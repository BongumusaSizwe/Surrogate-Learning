# Architecture 2

This architecture uses the CNN implemented using AlexNet Classifier. We explore the effects of different hyperparameters for this architecture in the reinforement learning space and in the supervised learning space.

In this folder
- there is a script, "trainer.sh", which trains agents, save models and generate the models to be tested on the Pong game. 

- test.py is responsible for testing the rl agent performance and thus generating the game score. The game score is determined by the reward collected over time.

The different models are found in the models folder which consists of the following:
1. Batch Size
2. Learning Rate
